## About

This project is a spigot plugin that swaps the locations of players. Players try to trap each other to win.

## Installation

Download the latest version from [releases](https://github.com/KaiNakamura/DeathSwap/releases) and place the JAR file in the plugins folder of your server.

## Commands

| Command | Description | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/start` | Start the game | Sets time to 0 and gives all players a tracking compass, full health, and full hunger |
| `/stop` | Stop the game | |
| `/config [player]` | Open config gui | If more than one player is editing the config, the latest changes take priority, see [config](#config) for more details |
| `/swap [seconds]` | Set time in seconds before next swap | If no time is given, swaps immediately |

*If a command from this plugin conflicts with a command from another plugin use the prefix:*

`/deathswap:<command>`

## Config

The config file is a list of editable settings to change different aspects of gameplay. The easiest way to change the config is with the `/config` command.

For more control over the config, navigate to the [config.yml](https://github.com/KaiNakamura/DeathSwap/blob/master/src/main/resources/config.yml) file in the plugins folder of your server under `DeathSwap\config.yml`

| Attribute | Default | Description | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `swap-time` | 300 seconds | The time in seconds until players swap | |
| `warning-time` | 20 seconds | The time in seconds before swapping in which warnings will be given | |
| `warning-sounds` | true | Play sound when warning is given | |
| `world-border-size` | 300 blocks | The size in blocks of the world border | Recommended to keep within the spawn chunks for optimal performance (19 chunks or 304 blocks) |
